#This project also includes Unit testing using cunitTest Frame work:

This framework generates a file XML includes all test cases that are success or Failed.

Also unit test made me to refactor the code in the fucture.

#This project Also includes CMake Building Tool which is Crossplat form tool to generate makefile or eclipse and many other files you can see by using this command (cmake --help):

I am  using CMake to make the program is suitable for any Operating system windows or Linux or MAC.
